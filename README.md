#Celsius And Fahrenheit

**Hi Everybody!**

This is a weather app I built in objective-c to help in the morning. You see, my partner is Mexican and I am from the US, so every morning we talk about what the temperature is like outside to dress appropriately. But she relates to celsius and I only understand fahrenheit! The conversion is 째F = 째C x 9/5 + 32   or  째C = (째F - 32) x 5/9  depending on the direction and my mental math is not the best right when I wake up. Inspiration struck and this fun little app is the result. The illustrations are original and have some subtle and silly animations just for fun.  Hope you enjoy it!
